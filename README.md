git and github is, to me, like having multiple copies of something and being able to edit something without making all of those changes to the actual project or whatever you may be working on. It also helps teams work together and make things a bit easier, as long as you know how to use git and github lol.

If it wasn't for these branches and master branches, i can see how someones mistake would mess up alot of things if it were just pushed over and over to master without review or checking items before.
